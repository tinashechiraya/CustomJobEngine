Got it â€” you want a clean, **developer-friendly** `README.md` for your custom background job runner.  
I'll make it professional but still simple and straightforward, covering:

- **Overview**
- **Setup**
- **Allowed Jobs**
- **Creating Jobs**
- **Running Jobs**
- **Retry Logic Configuration**
- **Example Usage**
- **Final notes**

Hereâ€™s your full `README.md` draft:

# Custom Background Job Runner

This is a custom lightweight background job runner for Laravel projects, without using Laravelâ€™s default queue system.

It supports **retry logic**, **whitelisting allowed jobs and methods**, and **manual CLI job execution**.

---

## 1. Setup

Follow these steps to get started:

### Prerequisites

- PHP 8.1+ installed
- Composer installed
- Laravel project set up

---

### Installation

1. Clone or copy this project into your Laravel project directory.

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

3. Run the Laravel bootstrap (first time setup):

```bash
php artisan migrate
php artisan config:cache
```

4. Ensure the `storage/logs/` directory exists. Create it manually if it does not exist.

---

## 2. Allowed Jobs

All classes and methods that can be executed must be explicitly registered.

The configuration for allowed jobs is located in:

```
/config/background-jobs.php
```

Example of the config structure:

```php
<?php

return [
    'retry_attempts' => 3, // Number of retry attempts
    'retry_delay' => 5,     // Delay in seconds between retries

    'allowed_jobs' => [
        App\Jobs\SampleJobClass::class => [
            'process',
            'handle',
        ],
    ],
];
```

âœ… Only classes and methods defined here can be run via CLI.

---

## 3. Creating Jobs

Create your job classes under any namespace (e.g., `App\Jobs`).

Example:

```php
namespace App\Jobs;

class SampleJobClass
{
    public function process($param1, $param2)
    {
        // Job logic here
    }

    public function handle()
    {
        // Another method
    }
}
```

- Each method you intend to run should be public.
- Make sure the class and methods are added to the `allowed_jobs` config.

---

## 4. Running Jobs

The main runner script is:

```
/run-job.php
```

It expects arguments in the following order:

```bash
php run-job.php [ClassName] [MethodName] [ParametersCommaSeparated]
```

### Example Commands:

Run `process` method on `SampleJobClass`:

```bash
php run-job.php App\\Jobs\\SampleJobClass process param1,param2
```

> Note: Double backslashes `\\` are needed to escape the namespace separator.

Run `handle` method without parameters:

```bash
php run-job.php App\\Jobs\\SampleJobClass handle
```

---

## 5. Retry Attempts and Delays

You can control retry behavior in:

```
/config/background-jobs.php
```

Edit these settings:

```php
'retry_attempts' => 3, // Number of times to retry the job if it fails
'retry_delay' => 5,    // Seconds to wait before retrying
```

- If the job method throws an exception, it will automatically retry based on these settings.

---

## 6. Error Logging

The runner logs output to:

- **Successful execution logs:**  
  `/storage/logs/background_jobs.log`

- **Failure and exception logs:**  
  `/storage/logs/background_jobs_errors.log`

---

## 7. Key Files Structure

| File | Purpose |
|:-----|:--------|
| `run-job.php` | Main runner script. Handles argument parsing, validation, execution, and retry. |
| `config/background-jobs.php` | Whitelist of allowed jobs and retry settings. |
| `storage/logs/` | Directory for logging job execution results and errors. |

---

## 8. Notes

- Make sure to always register new job classes and methods in `background-jobs.php`.
- Jobs should be designed to be **idempotent** (safe to retry).
- You can modify or extend `run-job.php` if you want additional features like notifications, database job tracking, etc.

You can now add screenshots where needed to show:

- CLI command examples
- Job config example
- Log output examples

Would you also want me to give you a **smaller version** (like a short quickstart) that you can put right after the main one if you want both a full and short readme? ðŸ“š  
(It's good for people who just want a 1-minute "how to use" version.)
